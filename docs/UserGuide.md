## Introduction
ZooKeep is a desktop app for managing animals under a zookeeper’s care, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ZooKeep can get your management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `ZooKeep.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy `ZooKeep.jar` to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the app.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   <br> Here are some example commands you can try:

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Hershey`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [m/MEDICAL CONDITION]` can be used as `n/Hershey m/Healthy` or as `n/Hershey`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[f/FEEDING TIME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `f/0600`, `f/0600 f/1800` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/SPECIES i/ID`, `n/NAME i/ID s/SPECIES` is also acceptable.

#### Manually saving data

Animal data is saved in the hard disk with the preferred file name automatically after any command that changes the data. 
By default, the preferred file name is `zookeepbook.json`
There is no need to save manually, though a copy of the current data can be created with the `snap` command. 

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ZooKeep home folder.
