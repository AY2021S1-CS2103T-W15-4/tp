## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo feature (by Zhi Yuan)

#### Implementation

The undo feature is facilitated by a stack data structure.

The `HistoryStack` class wraps a stack designed to hold `ReadOnlyZooKeepBook` objects.

The Singleton Pattern is employed here since only one history instance should exist in the running of the application.

`HistoryStack` supports the following key features:

* `HistoryStack#addToHistory(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)` - Adds the given state of the book into history only if it differs from the most recent state.
* `HistoryStack#removeRecentHistory()` - Removes the most recent state of the book from the history.
* `HistoryStack#viewRecentHistory()` - Returns the most recent state of the book.
* `HistoryStack#clearHistory()` - Clears the history.

The undo feature also depends on the following existing methods:
* `Model#setZooKeepBook(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)` - Replaces the current model's book data with the given.
* `Model#getZooKeepBook()` - Returns the model's current book.

The following classes reference the above methods:
* `UndoCommand`
* `LogicManager`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Classes pertaining to the Redo command also refer to these methods, but will be excluded here and explained in the section below instead.

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `HistoryStack` will be initialized with a single state, which is the current state.

![UndoState0](images/UndoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 1` command to delete the animal with ID 1. `LogicManager` calls `Model#getZooKeepBook()` to retrieve the new state of the book, and adds it to the history with `HistoryStack#addToHistory(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)`.

![UndoState1](images/UndoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `help` to view the help screen. `LogicManager` behaves as per Step 2. However, since no changes were made to the state, the current state is not added to `HistoryStack`.

![UndoState2](images/UndoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `HistoryStack#addToHistory()`, so the state will not be saved into the `HistoryStack`.

</div>


Step 4. The user now decides that deleting the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `HistoryStack#removeRecentHistory()` which deletes the current state, and exposes the previous state. `HistoryStack#viewRecentHistory()` is then called to retrieve the previous state, then loaded into the model using `Model#setZooKeepBook(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)`.

![UndoState3](images/UndoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `HistoryStack` only contains a single state, then there is no previous state to restore. The `undo` command uses `HistoryStack#getHistorySize()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>


The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>


The following 2 activity diagrams summarize what happens when a user executes a new command and when a user executes the undo command:

New command | Undo command
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![ExecuteCommandActivityDiagram](images/ExecuteCommandActivityDiagram.png) | ![UndoCommandActivityDiagram](images/UndoCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ZooKeep book as a state.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, works with all commands immediately.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as product scales.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### Redo feature (by Jun Cheng)

#### Implementation

The Redo feature was added as a complement to the Undo feature which was done earlier. The addition of this
feature required the integration of the `RedoCommand` class, which extends from the `Command` class like all other commands.
The `HistoryStack` class also has new key features to support the `redo` command:

* `HistoryStack#addToRedo(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)` - Adds a given state of the ZooKeep book into the redo stack.
* `HistoryStack#removeRecentRedo()` - Removes the most 'recent' update of the ZooKeep book from the redo stack.
* `HistoryStack#viewRecentRedo()` - Returns (but does not remove) the most 'recent' update of the ZooKeep book.
* `HistoryStack#clearRedo()` - Clears the future updates of the ZooKeep book stored in the redo stack.

The `RedoCommand` class references some of these methods to accomplish the feature required. Given below is an example
usage scenario and how the redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The ZooKeep book is initialised with the initial state
given in `data/zookeepbook.json`, and the `HistoryStack` consists of 2 stacks; the history stack and the redo stack,
each in their respective initial states.

![RedoState0](images/RedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Harambe...` to add a new animal into the ZooKeep book. The `LogicManager` calls
`Model#getZooKeepBook()` to retrieve the new state of the book and calls `HistoryStack#addToHistory(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)`
as per normal undo protocol.

![RedoState1](images/RedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user then executes `delete 567` which deletes the animal in the book with an ID of 567. Similar to step 2, 
`LogicManager` will call `Model#getZooKeepBook()` to retrieve the new state of the book and then calls 
`HistoryStack#addToHistory(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)` to store this state into the history stack.

![RedoState2](images/RedoState2.png)

Step 4. Now the user thinks that deleting that animal was a mistake and restores the previous state by 
executing `undo` (explained in the previous section). However, before the current state is deleted and replaced with 
the previous one, `HistoryStack#addToRedo(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)` is called to store the current state into the redo 
stack for further use.

![RedoState3](images/RedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If `UndoCommand` is never executed, the 
redo stack will remain empty and calling `RedoCommand` will do nothing, since there are no future states recorded in
the stack for retrieval. 

</div>

Step 5. However, now the user decides that deleting that animal was the correct decision after all, and now executes 
`redo` which calls `HistoryStack#viewRecentRedo()` to retrieve the future state of the ZooKeep book where the animal
was deleted. The future state is then loaded into the model using `Model#setZooKeepBook(ReadOnlyZooKeepBook)`.
Lastly, `HistoryStack#removeRecentRedo()` is called to delete that state from redo stack. 

![RedoState4](images/RedoState4.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If commands which alter the state of the 
ZooKeep book (e.g. add or delete) are executed after an undo command, the redo stack will be emptied since the 
immediate future has been altered and the future states previously stored in the redo stack are now invalid. Hence 
executing redo now will do nothing.

</div>


The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `Redo` operation is performed:

![RedoSequenceDiagram](images/RedoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `RedoCommand` should end 
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following 2 activity diagrams summarise what happens when a user executes the `undo` and `redo` commands:

Undo command | Redo command
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![UndoCommandWithRedoActivityDiagram](images/UndoCommandWithRedoActivityDiagram.png) | ![RedoCommandActivityDiagram](images/RedoCommandActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ZooKeep book as a state.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, works with all commands immediately.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as product scales.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### Snapshot feature (by Aizat)

#### Implementation

The snapshot feature is implemented by the `SnapCommand` and `SnapCommandParser` classes. `SnapCommandParser`
parses the user's input as a file name and then creates a `SnapCommand` object with the file name as a parameter.

`SnapCommand` executes by copying the current state of the zookeep book and then utilising
`StorageManager`'s save method to save the zookeep book with the specified file name.

#### Design considerations:

* We chose to prevent users from creating a snapshot if the specified file name already exists
as overwriting a file is irreversible and would be disastrous for zookeepers if done unintentionally

### Sort feature (by Malcolm)

#### Implementation

This section explains the implementation of the Sort command feature in the ZooKeepBook. This feature is used to sort the animals based on the different categories: **name, id or feedtime**.
* For the animal name, it will be in alphabetical order.
* For the animal id, it will be in increasing order.
* For the animal feed time, it will be from earliest to latest. 
  
The following sequence diagram shows the Logic and Model Components when a sort command is being executed:
![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:  **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

In the **Logic** Component,
After the user keys in "sort name" as input, these key methods are called:
* `LogicManager#execute("sort name")`: The `LogicManager` takes in a command text string ("sort name/id/feedtime").
* `ZooKeepBookParser#parseCommand("sort name")`: The `ZooKeepBookParser` parses the user input into a command word ("sort") and arguments ("name"). Using the command word, a `SortCommandParser` is created. 
* `SortCommandParser#parse("name")`: The `SortCommandParser` takes in the argument("name") and parses it. An `AnimalComparator` is created and contains the specific static comparator required to sort the animals according to the category provided. A `SortCommand` is created with the `AnimalComparator` as an attribute.
	* The `AnimalComparator` contains 3 different static comparators to be used for sorting: `ANIMAL_NAME_COMPARATOR`,  `ANIMAL_ID_COMPARATOR` and `ANIMAL_FEEDTIME_COMPARATOR`.
	* In this case, the `ANIMAL_NAME_COMPARATOR` is taken.
* `SortCommand#execute(model)`: The `SortCommand` uses the `AnimalComparator` to sort the animals and returns a `CommandResult` object which represents the result of a command execution. 

In the **Model** Component,
The in-memory model of the ZooKeepBook data sorts and updates the animal list. The following key methods are used: 
* `Model#sortAnimals(animalComparator)`: sorts the animals in the `ZooKeepBook` using the given `AnimalComparator` object.
* `ZooKeepBook#sortAnimals(animalComparator)` : Retrieves the static comparator in the `AnimalComparator` object and creates a `SortedList` object. The `UniqueAnimalList` in the `ZooKeepBook` is then replaced by this `SortedList` object.
* `ZooKeepBook#updateFilteredAnimalList(predicate)`: Updates the filter of the filtered animal list to filter by the given predicate, which will be true here so that the sorted list will be displayed once sorted.

Upon the completion of the user command, a success message (Sorted all animals by name) and the updated sorted list is displayed below the message.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a sort command.

![SortCommandActivityDiagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)
  
#### Design Consideration  
##### Aspect: Sorting based on different categories  
We chose to allow the user to sort not only based on animal names but also by their id and feedtime to ease the convenience of the user when he needs data to be sorted in other ways.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of animals
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: 
*  Zookeepers have to account for a large number of animals and their statuses (health, feeding times etc).

*   It is easy to lose track without a structured database.

*   We have thus decided to morph the app into a tracker for an individual zookeeper.

*   Easier to transfer a large amount of animal information when zookeepers change shifts.
* Manage animals faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app.

### User stories

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**
